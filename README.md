Learning CSS Grid
This project is a simple webpage demonstrating various applications of the CSS Grid Layout. It includes examples of basic grids, grid template areas, responsive grids, and nested grids.

Project Structure
The project consists of two main files:

index.html: This is where all of our HTML content is stored. We have different sections in this file to demonstrate each of the grid types.

style.css: This is where all of our styling goes. It's linked to the index.html file, and it contains the CSS needed to create our grids.

Examples
Here are the grid types that we're demonstrating in this project:

Basic Grid
A basic grid layout with equal-width columns. It's a great starting point to understand how grids work.

.grid-basic {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-gap: 10px;
}

Grid Template Areas
We can give names to parts of our grid layout using template areas. This makes it easier to arrange our layout and understand what each section does.

.grid-template {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        "header header header"
        "nav content content"
        "nav footer footer";
    grid-gap: 10px;
}

Responsive Grid
We can create grids that adjust to the screen size using the auto-fit keyword and the minmax() function. This makes our design responsive and user-friendly.

.grid-responsive {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    grid-gap: 10px;
}

Nested Grid
Grids can be nested inside other grid items. This allows us to create more complex layouts.

.grid-nested {
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 10px;
}

.grid-nested .item {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    grid-gap: 10px;
}

Conclusion
CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that can handle a variety of complex layouts with ease. By understanding these basic concepts, you can start creating more intricate and responsive designs. Enjoy exploring CSS Grid!
